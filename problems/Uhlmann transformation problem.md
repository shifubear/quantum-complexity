Let $\kappa, \eta: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow [0, 1]$ be functions. The **$(\kappa, \eta)$-Uhlmann transformation problem** is the [[unitary synthesis problem]] $UHLMANN_{\kappa, \eta} = (U_x)_{x \in \{0, 1\}}^*$ where whenever $x$ is a fidelity-$\kappa(n)$ [[valid Uhlmann instance]] specifying a pair $(C, D)$ of unitary circuits that each act on $2n$ qubits for some $n$, then $U_x$ is the [[canonical Uhlmann partial isometry]] with cutoff $\eta$ for the states $\ket{C} = C\ket{0^{2n}}$ and $\ket{D} = D\ket{0^{2n}}$ with $U_x$ acting on the last $n$ qubits. Otherwise, if $x$ is not a valid Uhlmann instance, then we define $U_x=0$.    

The **$(\kappa, \eta)$-succinct Uhlmann transformation problem**, denoted by $SUCCINCTUHLMANN_{\kappa, \eta}$, is a sequence $(U_x)_x$ where whenever $x$ is a valid fidelity-$\kappa(n)$ succinct [[valid Uhlmann instance]] specifying a pair $(C, D)$ of unitary circuits that act on $2n$ qubits for some $n$, then $U_x$ is the canonical $\eta$-Uhlmann isometry for the states $\ket{C} = C\ket{0^{2n}}$ and $\ket{D} = D\ket{0^{2n}}$, with $U_x$ acting on the last $n$ qubits. If $x$ is not a valid Uhlmann instance, then we define $U_x=0$.
