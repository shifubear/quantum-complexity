Consider a setting where we have a register $A$ and another register storing a projective measurement we want to perform.
There seems to be a gap in the hardness between general measurement ($\sc{stateQIP}$) vs performing an AGSP for certain classes of Hamiltonians ($\sc{BQP}$ probably also $\sc{stateBQP}$). Can there be an approximate measurement protocol that lies between these? 

Current state of the art for AGSP algorithms:

- BQP algorithm for AGSP
	- Polynomial time (?) optimal approximation of 1D GSPs and other classes of local hamiltonians
