# Definition 
A family of quantum states $\{\ket{\psi_x}\}_{x\in L}$ is in $\sc{stateBQP}_\delta[\gamma]$ if each $\ket{\psi_x}$ is an $n$-qubit state where $n := |x|$, and there exists a uniformly generated quantum circuit family $\{Q_x\}_{x\in L}$, which takes no inputs, such that for all $x \in L$:
- The circuit $Q_x$ outputs a (probably mixed) quantum state $\rho_x$ satisfying $\text{td}(\rho_x, \psi_x) \leq \delta(n)$ if $Q_x$ succeeds. Here, we define the success of circuit $Q_x$ as the measurement outcome of the designated output qubit being 1. 
- The success probability of $Q_x$ is at least $\gamma$.
