# Statement
Let $\ket{\psi}_{AB}$ and $\ket{\varphi}_{AB}$ be pure states on registers $AB$ and denote their reduced states on register $A$ by $\rho_A$ and $\sigma_A$, respectively. Then, there exists a unitary $U_B$ acting only on register $B$ such that 
$$F(\rho_A, \sigma_A) = |\bra{\varphi}_{AB}(I_A \otimes U_B) \ket{\psi}_{AB}|^2$$
where $F$ is the [[fidelity]].
