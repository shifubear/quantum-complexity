Any bipartite quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ on $A \otimes B$ can be written as 
$$\ket{\psi} = \sum_i \sqrt{p_i} \ket{\alpha_i} \ket{\beta_i}$$
for some orthonormal bases $\{\ket{\alpha_i}\}$ and $\{\ket{\beta_i}\}$ on systems $A$ and $B$ respectively, and a probability distribution $\{p_i\}$. The number of nonzero coefficients is called the **Schmidt rank** of the state over the two subsystems.
