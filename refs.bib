  abstract = {These are lecture notes from a weeklong course in quantum complexity theory taught at the Bellairs Research Institute in Barbados, February 21-25, 2016. The focus is quantum circuit complexity---i.e., the minimum number of gates needed to prepare a given quantum state or apply a given unitary transformation---as a unifying theme tying together several topics of recent interest in the field. Those topics include the power of quantum proofs and advice states; how to construct quantum money schemes secure against counterfeiting; and the role of complexity in the black-hole information paradox and the AdS/CFT correspondence (through connections made by Harlow-Hayden, Susskind, and others). The course was taught to a mixed audience of theoretical computer scientists and quantum gravity / string theorists, and starts out with a crash course on quantum information and computation in general.},

  abstract = {This paper studies whether quantum proofs are more powerful than classical proofs, or in complexity terms, whether QMA=QCMA. We prove three results about this question. First, we give a "quantum oracle separation" between QMA and QCMA. More concretely, we show that any quantum algorithm needs \$\textbackslash Omega(\textbackslash sqrt\{2\^n/(m+1)\})\$ queries to find an \$n\$-qubit "marked state" \$\textbackslash lvert\textbackslash psi\textbackslash rangle\$, even if given an \$m\$-bit classical description of \$\textbackslash lvert\textbackslash psi\textbackslash rangle\$ together with a quantum black box that recognizes \$\textbackslash lvert\textbackslash psi\textbackslash rangle\$. Second, we give an explicit QCMA protocol that nearly achieves this lower bound. Third, we show that, in the one previously-known case where quantum proofs seemed to provide an exponential advantage, classical proofs are basically just as powerful. In particular, Watrous gave a QMA protocol for verifying non-membership in finite groups. Under plausible group-theoretic assumptions, we give a QCMA protocol for the same problem. Even with no assumptions, our protocol makes only polynomially many queries to the group oracle. We end with some conjectures about quantum versus classical oracles, and about the possibility of a classical oracle separation between QMA and QCMA.},

  abstract = {State transformation problems such as compressing quantum information or breaking quantum commitments are fundamental quantum tasks. However, their computational difficulty cannot easily be characterized using traditional complexity theory, which focuses on tasks with classical inputs and outputs. To study the complexity of such state transformation tasks, we introduce a framework for unitary synthesis problems, including notions of reductions and unitary complexity classes. We use this framework to study the complexity of transforming one entangled state into another via local operations. We formalize this as the Uhlmann Transformation Problem, an algorithmic version of Uhlmann's theorem. Then, we prove structural results relating the complexity of the Uhlmann Transformation Problem, polynomial space quantum computation, and zero knowledge protocols. The Uhlmann Transformation Problem allows us to characterize the complexity of a variety of tasks in quantum information processing, including decoding noisy quantum channels, breaking falsifiable quantum cryptographic assumptions, implementing optimal prover strategies in quantum interactive proofs, and decoding the Hawking radiation of black holes. Our framework for unitary complexity thus provides new avenues for studying the computational complexity of many natural quantum information processing tasks.},

  abstract = {Complexity theory typically focuses on the difficulty of solving computational problems using classical inputs and outputs, even with a quantum computer. In the quantum world, it is natural to apply a different notion of complexity, namely the complexity of synthesizing quantum states. We investigate a state-synthesizing counterpart of the class NP, referred to as stateQMA, which is concerned with preparing certain quantum states through a polynomial-time quantum verifier with the aid of a single quantum message from an all-powerful but untrusted prover. This is a subclass of the class stateQIP recently introduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), which permits polynomially many interactions between the prover and the verifier. Our main result consists of error reduction of this class and its variants with an exponentially small gap or a bounded space, as well as how this class relates to other fundamental state synthesizing classes, i.e., states generated by uniform polynomial-time quantum circuits (stateBQP) and space-uniform polynomial-space quantum circuits (statePSPACE). Furthermore, we establish that the family of UQMA witnesses, considered as one of the most natural candidates, is in stateQMA. Additionally, we demonstrate that stateQCMA achieves perfect completeness.},

  abstract = {It is a useful fact in classical computer science that many search problems are reducible to decision problems; this has led to decision problems being regarded as the \$\textbackslash textit\{de facto\}\$ computational task to study in complexity theory. In this work, we explore search-to-decision reductions for quantum search problems, wherein a quantum algorithm makes queries to a classical decision oracle to output a desired quantum state. In particular, we focus on search-to-decision reductions for \$\textbackslash mathsf\{QMA\}\$, and show that there exists a quantum polynomial-time algorithm that can generate a witness for a \$\textbackslash mathsf\{QMA\}\$ problem up to inverse polynomial precision by making one query to a \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PP\}\$ decision oracle. We complement this result by showing that \$\textbackslash mathsf\{QMA\}\$-search does \$\textbackslash textit\{not\}\$ reduce to \$\textbackslash mathsf\{QMA\}\$-decision in polynomial-time, relative to a quantum oracle. We also explore the more general \$\textbackslash textit\{state synthesis problem\}\$, in which the goal is to efficiently synthesize a target state by making queries to a classical oracle encoding the state. We prove that there exists a classical oracle with which any quantum state can be synthesized to inverse polynomial precision using only one oracle query and to inverse exponential precision using two oracle queries. This answers an open question of Aaronson from 2016, who presented a state synthesis algorithm that makes \$O(n)\$ queries to a classical oracle to prepare an \$n\$-qubit state, and asked if the query complexity could be made sublinear.},

  abstract = {Complexity theory traditionally studies the hardness of solving classical computational problems. In the quantum setting, it is also natural to consider a different notion of complexity, namely the complexity of physically preparing a certain quantum state. We study the relation between two such state complexity classes: statePSPACE, which contains states that can be generated by space-uniform polynomial-space quantum circuits, and stateQIP, which contains states that a polynomial-time quantum verifier can generate by interacting with an all-powerful untrusted quantum prover. The latter class was recently introduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), who proved that statePSPACE \$\textbackslash subseteq\$ stateQIP. Our main result is the reverse inclusion, stateQIP \$\textbackslash subseteq\$ statePSPACE, thereby establishing equality of the two classes and providing a natural state-complexity analogue to the celebrated QIP = PSPACE theorem of Jain, et al. (J. ACM 2011). To prove this, we develop a polynomial-space quantum algorithm for solving a large class of exponentially large "PSPACE-computable" semidefinite programs (SDPs), which also prepares an optimiser encoded in a quantum state. Our SDP solver relies on recent block-encoding techniques from quantum algorithms, demonstrating that these techniques are also useful for complexity theory. Using similar techniques, we also show that optimal prover strategies for general quantum interactive protocols can be implemented in quantum polynomial space. We prove this by studying an algorithmic version of Uhlmann's theorem and establishing an upper bound on the complexity of implementing Uhlmann transformations.},

Previous algorithms for this problem either used a linear number of queries and polynomial time [arXiv:1607.05256], or a constant number of queries and polynomially many ancillae but no nontrivial bound on the runtime [arXiv:2111.02999].

More generally we give a size-error tradeoff which, by a counting argument, is optimal for any finite gate set.},
