A **$k$-round quantum verifier circuit** $C = (C_j)_{j\in[k]}$ is a tuple of general quantum circuits that each act on a pair of registers $(\sc{V}, \sc{M})$. The register $\sc{V}$ is further divided into disjoint sub-registers $(\sc{V}_{work}, \sc{V}_{flag}, \sc{V}_{out})$. The register $\sc{V}_{work}$ is the verifier circuit's "workspace", the register $\sc{V}_{flag}$ is a single qubit indicating whether the verifier accepts or rejects, and the register $\sc{V}_{out}$ holds the verifier's output (if applicable). The register $\sc{M}$ is the message register. The size of a verifier circuit $C$ is the sum of the circuit sizes of the $C_j$'s.
