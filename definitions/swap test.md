# Definition [[@gilyen+2022]]
Given identical copies of density operators $\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ and $\sigma$, repeat the following circuit
![[swap test.png]]
$\log \left(\frac{2}{\nu}\right)/\eta^2$ many times with parameters $\eta \in (0, 1)$ and $\nu \in (0, 1)$ to obtain an additive $\eta$-approximation to the quantity $\braket{\psi|\sigma|\psi}$ with probability at least $1 - \nu$.
