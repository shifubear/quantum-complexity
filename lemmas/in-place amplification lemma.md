# Statement
Let $V$ be a QMA verifier that uses a $w$-qubit quantum witness, makes $T$ oracle queries, and has completeness and soundness errors 1/3. Then for all $s \geq 1$, there exists an amplified verifier $V_s'$ that uses a $w$-qubit quantum witness, makes $O(Ts)$ oracle queries, and has completeness and soundness errors $1/2^s$.
