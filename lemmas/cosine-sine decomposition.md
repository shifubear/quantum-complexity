Let $m = n/2$. Any unitary in $\mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$ can be written as 
$$\begin{pmatrix} P_0CQ_0 & -P_0SQ_1 \\ P_1SQ_0 & P_1CQ_1 \end{pmatrix}$$
for some unitaries $P_0, P_1, Q_0, Q_1 \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times m}$ and diagonal matrices $C, S$, where for all $j \in [m]$ the $j$'th diagonal elements of $C$ and $S$ are nonnegative real numbers whose squares sum to 1.
